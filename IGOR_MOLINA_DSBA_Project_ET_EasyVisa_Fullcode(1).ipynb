    "# EasyVisa Project\n",

    "## Context:\n",
    "\n",
    "Business communities in the United States are facing high demand for human resources, but one of the constant challenges is identifying and attracting the right talent, which is perhaps the most important element in remaining competitive. Companies in the United States look for hard-working, talented, and qualified individuals both locally as well as abroad.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) of the US permits foreign workers to come to the United States to work on either a temporary or permanent basis. The act also protects US workers against adverse impacts on their wages or working conditions by ensuring US employers' compliance with statutory requirements when they hire foreign workers to fill workforce shortages. The immigration programs are administered by the Office of Foreign Labor Certification (OFLC).\n",
    "\n",
    "OFLC processes job certification applications for employers seeking to bring foreign workers into the United States and grants certifications in those cases where employers can demonstrate that there are not sufficient US workers available to perform the work at wages that meet or exceed the wage paid for the occupation in the area of intended employment.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Objective:\n",
    "\n",
    "In FY 2016, the OFLC processed 775,979 employer applications for 1,699,957 positions for temporary and permanent labor certifications. This was a nine percent increase in the overall number of processed applications from the previous year. The process of reviewing every case is becoming a tedious task as the number of applicants is increasing every year.\n",
    "\n",
    "The increasing number of applicants every year calls for a Machine Learning based solution that can help in shortlisting the candidates having higher chances of VISA approval. OFLC has hired your firm EasyVisa for data-driven solutions. You as a data scientist have to analyze the data provided and, with the help of a classification model:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Facilitate the process of visa approvals.\n",
    "* Recommend a suitable profile for the applicants for whom the visa should be certified or denied based on the drivers that significantly influence the case status. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data Description\n",
    "\n",
    "The data contains the different attributes of the employee and the employer. The detailed data dictionary is given below.\n",
    "\n",
    "* case_id: ID of each visa application\n",
    "* continent: Information of continent the employee\n",
    "* education_of_employee: Information of education of the employee\n",
    "* has_job_experience: Does the employee has any job experience? Y= Yes; N = No\n",
    "* requires_job_training: Does the employee require any job training? Y = Yes; N = No \n",
    "* no_of_employees: Number of employees in the employer's company\n",
    "* yr_of_estab: Year in which the employer's company was established\n",
    "* region_of_employment: Information of foreign worker's intended region of employment in the US.\n",
    "* prevailing_wage:  Average wage paid to similarly employed workers in a specific occupation in the area of intended employment. The purpose of the prevailing wage is to ensure that the foreign worker is not underpaid compared to other workers offering the same or similar service in the same area of employment. \n",
    "* unit_of_wage: Unit of prevailing wage. Values include Hourly, Weekly, Monthly, and Yearly.\n",
    "* full_time_position: Is the position of work full-time? Y = Full Time Position; N = Part Time Position\n",
    "* case_status:  Flag indicating if the Visa was certified or denied"

    "* The dataset has 12 and 25480 rows.\n",
    "* There are a total of 25480 non-null observations in all the columns so we have not missing values.\n",
    "* The columns of the dataset are as follow: \"continent\", \"education_of_employee\", \"has_job_experience\", \"requires_job_training\", \"no_of_employees\", \"yr_of_estab\", \"region_of_employment \", \"prevailing_wage\", \"unit_of_wage\", \"full_time_position \", \"case_status\".\n",
    "* The dataset contains 11 columns: 8 are object type('continent ', 'education_of_employee', 'has_job_experience', 'requires_job_training', 'region_of_employment', 'unit_of_wage', 'full_time_position', and 'case_status'), 2 corresponds to a integer64 type ('no_of_employees' and 'yr_of_estab'), and just 1 belongs to float64 type('prevailing_wage).\n",

    " * The Decision Tree tuned improve the performance but the metrics were not balanced.\n",
    " * The Bagging tuned model did not improve the metrics of the model made by the default model.\n",
    " * The Random Forest tuned model improved almost all the metrics but they were unbalanced.\n",
    " * The AdaBoost tuned model improved some metrics notably but in most decrease performance.\n",
    " * The Gradient Boosting tuned model remained practically the same as the version made by default.\n",
    " * The XGBoost tuned model only improved two of the metrics and the others decreased their performance.\n",
    " * The Stacking model had a good fit on both sets. The F1 score results were comparable with other models, with no major variations."

    "* In this project, it is important to highlight that the initial Bagging models, both pre-tuned and tuned tended to overfit on the train dataset. \n",
    "* The XGBoost model overfits a little bit on the train dataset on the pre-tuned model. Although, it reduced the overfitting after applying the hyperparameters.\n",
    "* The AdaBoost model performed slightly better with the default conditions or pre-tuned, but instead it reduced its performance after applying the hyperparameters.\n",
    "* The Stacking model had a very steady performance on the metrics and kept the f1 score in 0.82 in the test data as other models did.\n",
    "* The Gradient Boost Model had a steady, balanced and similar performance either before and after the tuning process. In fact, the F1 score metric was practically the same in both models 0.83-0.82. So having on mind that, we should select the less complex model with the best metrics, this is the reason I consider that the Gradient Boost pre-hyperparameters is the right one in this case."
